## About
My goal with this application was to be able to collect data from the terminal inputted by the user and print these to a html file displaying and showcasing the inputted data. This then would be tested using jest. 

I started off by adding in the DS_Store to the gitignore within the starter code as i am using a Mac. I then followed the steps to create the appropirate questions for each role. One they were all added in I ran node index.js in the built in terminal. 

You can see here the command line prompts when running node

The user is first greeted with the input option for the manager. It asks for their name, employee ID, email and office number (which was requested within the task). 

Once you have added the managers details you can then choose to add an engineer, and intern or finish building the team. The input questions within the terminal are what has been requested in the task. 

Once all team member have been added in you will see the message displayed 'Team profile successfully generated in team.html. As seen below.

This then prints to rhe team.html in the output folder and displays like this on a browser.

The other part of the challenge was to be able to utilise jest and run tests on our code. This was accomplished by calling 'npm test' in the intergrated terminal. Below is a screen shot of the results. It passed all the tests set out.
